    "Another useful method is `.str.extract()`; rather than checking **if** a string contains a particular sequence, it extracts the text that matches a particular pattern. This is overkill if you're just checking an exact sequence: use `str.contains()` in that case. However, if you are looking to get information of a specific type from a string (telephone numbers, product codes, colours of clothing), then combining `.str.extract()` with a regular expression is the neatest way to get the information that you want.\n",

In regular expressions, you define a capturing group with round brackets. A pattern without these round brackets will fail, because Pandas won't know which bit of the pattern you actually want to get back.\n",
